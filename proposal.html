			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>Since being formed in 1980, the Phoenix-based Make-A-Wish Foundation has become synonymous with fostering goodwill
				toward children with serious illnesses. Anyone under the age of 18 can petition the organization with a request for a
				trip, celebrity visit, or other special arrangement. In almost all cases, they’ll grant the child’s wish via fundraising
				efforts and the generosity of volunteers. An average of one wish is granted every 17 minutes. </p>
			<h3 id="Description"> Description of Make-A-Wish </h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p> <em> "Make-A-Wish creates life-changing wishes for children with critical illnesses. Our mission is to grant the wish of every eligible child – a quest sparked by the belief that a wish is integral to a child’s treatment." </em> </p>

      <h3 id = "User Justification">  User Research: </h3> 
      <h4> Identification of User Groups: </h4>
      <p> In order to identify and research the user group of Make-A-Wish, I looked at the social engagements between the charity's Facebook and Instagram accounts. This shows the demographic of volunteers within this charity can be saperate into 3 main groups: teenagers (16-24), adults (25-50), and elders (60-80). Whilst the demographic for donors can be assumed as people with stable income and similarly aged to volunteers. Moreover, their promotional videos on Youtube and their official website also portrays this statement. </p> 

			<h3 id="profiles">User Profiles</h3>
			<p>Below are the 3 user profiles/personas that were made following the user research conducted:</p>

			<h2>Ideation</h2>
			<p>The ideation stage is the beginning stages of the design process which help enable designers to uncover their final presentation.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Mood boards</li>
        </br>
				<li>Sitemaps</li>
        </br>
				<li>sketches</li>
        </br>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>
			<p>Moodboards are imperative within the ideation process as they enable to visualise and draft the direction the appearance and potential styles of the website.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="image/moodboard.png" alt="moodboard" width="100%">

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      <h3 id ="sitemaps">Sitemaps</h3>
      <p>Sitemaps allows me to understand and plan out the contents that will be used for my website. It also helps me to explore different types of contents that I could consider to add on and find out the most appropriate layout of the website</p>
      <figure>
          <img src="image/sitemap.png" alt="sitemap" width="100%">
          <figcaption>
            <center>Sitemap<center>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
			<h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
			<p>My first iteration consisted of sketches allowed me to quickly brainstorm many ideas for the concept and the layout of the design. These sketches allows me to explore different structures and elements that inspired by the mood board.</p>
      <h4> Home Landing Page: </h4>
         <figure>
          <img src="image/sketches.png" alt="sketches" width="100%">
          <figcaption>
            <center>sketches<center>
          </figcaption>
         </figure>
         <h5> Final concept </h5>
      <p> I decided to go with this design as not only was it simplistic, but it also contain the main information that I would like to deliver to the user. As there will be placing several wishes, descriptions, and pictures on the first landing board, this allows user to easily access to the main goal of Make-A-Wish.</p> 
         <figure>
          <img src="image/finalsketch.png" alt="final" width="100%">
          <figcaption>
            <center>Landing page<center>
          </figcaption>
         </figure>
    <h4>Our impact page:</h4>
    <p>
      This page is aimed to let the user understand what Make-A-Wish contributes to the community and the world. This page will demonstrate various  a world map of their impact globally and statistics/data inforgraphic styles to demonstrate the impact of Make-A-Wish.
    </p>
           <figure>
          <img src="image/ourimpact.png" alt="ourimpact" width="100%">

            <center>Our impact<center>
          </figcaption>
         </figure>
    <h5> Final Decision </h5> 
    <p>In order to deliver all the information about Make-A-Wish's impact, I decide to combine both 3 and 4 design together. This allows users to see the stories and wishes from different children, access to the statistics of (how many children has been supported by) the organisation, and their location on the world map.</p>
    <figure>
          <img src="image/ourimpactfinal.png" alt="ourimpactfinal" width="100%">
          <figcaption>
            <center>Our impact<center>
          </figcaption>
         </figure>
    <h4>Your impact page:</h4>
    <p>
      The purpose of this page is to encourage users to donate, and understand how their donation can be used to help those children who are experiencing life-threatening illness. My design focus was on how to present this information in a simple and clean style, which allows the user to easily understand the statistics of the foundation.
    </p>
           <figure>
          <img src="image/yourimpact.png" alt="yourimpact" width="100%">
          <figcaption>
            <center>Your impact<center>
          </figcaption>
         </figure>
    <h5> Final Decision </h5> 
    <p>I decide to use design 4 as my final design. As this page's aim is to simply shows how the users' money will support the children.</p>
    <figure>
          <img src="image/yourimpact1.png" alt="yourimpactfinal" width="100%">
          <figcaption>
            <center>Your impact<center>
          </figcaption>
         </figure>
    <h4>Donate page:</h4>
    <p>
      The purpose of this page is to encourage users to donate. In order to attract user's attention on how their money going to support the kids, I designed that when the user tap on the amount of money they would like to donate, they can see how the money going to make a change to the child. For example, <em>$30 could help create wish anticipation, helping a child have fun rather than focusing on their treatment.(Make-A-Wish, 2020)</em>
    </p>
           <figure>
          <img src="image/Donate.png" alt="donate" width="100%">
          <figcaption>
            <center>donate page<center>
          </figcaption>
         </figure>
    <h5> Final Decision </h5> 
    <p>I decide to use design 2 as it clean and simple. It also conduct the information of how the user going to help the kids directly. This allows users to easily understand how the donate page work. The right side menu of how their donation can help the children can increase their willing to donate.</p>
    <figure>
          <img src="image/donate1.png" alt="donate" width="100%">

			<h2>Designs</h2>
			<p>Following the development and exploration of my sketches, I developed my design via both wireframes that presenting the overall structure and basic form of my proposed website mockups to convey the visual style of the website.</p>
			<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
			<p>Wireframes are sketches that have been drawn over many iterations with a high degree of fidelity. This step is very important in the design process for solidification mockups.</p>
