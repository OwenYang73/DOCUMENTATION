			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<p>Based on the simple website mockup from the existing concept, I started to try to build it. As mentioned in <a href="proposal.html">my proposal</a>，I want to design a website that encourage people to donate to be the main call to action for this Non-profit organizations,and the style of it is simple and clear, as well as the tone will use the colors that make users feel comfortable and energetic.</p>
			
		<section id="Development">
			<h2>Development</h2>
			<p>I had introduced various changes to the actual website. I had changed the website to 3 pages: Landing page that includes Organisation's impact and user's impact, a Join Us page which users can register as a member of the organisation, and a Donate page. Instead of users need to jimp between different pages, I had changed "Our imapct" page and "Your impact" page into the first page. After these, I had added a footer that allows users to access to Make-A-Wish's official social media account (facebook, instagram, twitter, and youtube). </p>
      <p><b>The website was developed base on this moodboard.</b></p>

			<h3 id="Landingpage">Landing Page</h3>
			<p>I had changed the landing page from one single picture, into a scrollable page that user can direcly see the impact of the organisation. This can effectively allows users to understand the purpose of the organisation and encourage them to join or donate.</p>

			<h3 id="yourimpacts">Donate</h3>
			<p>I had added a footer into the donate page. This allows users to use the quick links to go back home page and join us page. Moreover, users can press the button on the right to choose how much they want to donate. </p>
